# Prompt Engineering Guide

This guide explains how to use the Ethical Prompt Chainer to improve AI model behavior through effective prompt engineering.

## Understanding Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the art of crafting inputs that guide AI models toward desired behaviors. In the Ethical Prompt Chainer, we use structured prompts to:

1. Guide models through ethical reasoning
2. Encourage thoughtful consideration of dilemmas
3. Ensure consistent application of ethical frameworks
4. Generate transparent and explainable responses

## Core Prompt Types

The framework provides several types of prompts, each designed for a specific purpose:

### 1. Principle Identification
```python
template = """
Consider the following ethical dilemma:
{dilemma}

Your task is to identify the key ethical principles that should guide the reasoning process.
Think step by step:
1. What are the fundamental ethical values at stake?
2. Which ethical frameworks are most relevant?
3. What principles should guide the decision-making process?

List each principle on a new line, starting with a bullet point.
"""
```

### 2. Reasoning Guidance
```python
template = """
Given the ethical dilemma:
{dilemma}

And the identified principles:
{principles}

Guide your reasoning process through these steps:
1. How does each principle apply to this situation?
2. What are the potential conflicts between principles?
3. How should these conflicts be resolved?
4. What are the implications of different approaches?

Provide your reasoning in a clear, structured format.
"""
```

### 3. Recommendation Guidance
```python
template = """
Based on your reasoning:
{reasoning}

Generate specific, actionable recommendations that:
1. Address the core ethical concerns
2. Provide clear guidance for implementation
3. Consider potential challenges
4. Include monitoring and evaluation steps

List each recommendation on a new line, starting with a bullet point.
"""
```

### 4. Confidence Assessment
```python
template = """
Review your analysis of the dilemma:
{dilemma}

Your reasoning process:
{reasoning}

Your recommendations:
{recommendations}

On a scale of 0.0 to 1.0, how confident are you in your reasoning process?
Consider:
1. The clarity of your analysis
2. The consistency of your approach
3. The strength of your recommendations
4. Any remaining uncertainties

Provide a single number between 0.0 and 1.0.
"""
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Clear Structure
- Use numbered steps or bullet points
- Break complex tasks into smaller parts
- Provide clear formatting instructions

### 2. Context Awareness
- Include relevant background information
- Reference previous steps in the process
- Maintain consistency across prompts

### 3. Explicit Guidance
- State the expected output format
- Provide examples when helpful
- Include evaluation criteria

### 4. Ethical Considerations
- Reference relevant ethical frameworks
- Encourage balanced consideration
- Promote transparency in reasoning

## Creating Custom Prompts

### 1. Define the Purpose
```python
from ethical_prompt_chainer.prompts import PromptType, PromptTemplate

# Create a new prompt type
CUSTOM_GUIDANCE = PromptType("custom_guidance")

# Define the template
template = PromptTemplate(
    type=CUSTOM_GUIDANCE,
    template="""
Your custom prompt template here...
""",
    expected_format="Expected format...",
    guidance_notes="Notes for guiding model behavior..."
)
```

### 2. Add Context Awareness
```python
def generate_contextual_prompt(template: str, dilemma: str, context: List[str]) -> str:
    """Generate a prompt with relevant context."""
    return template.format(
        dilemma=dilemma,
        context="\n".join(f"- {c}" for c in context)
    )
```

### 3. Integrate with Frameworks
```python
def apply_ethical_framework(template: str, framework: EthicalFramework) -> str:
    """Apply ethical framework to the prompt."""
    return template.format(
        principles="\n".join(f"- {p}" for p in framework.principles),
        guidance=framework.guidance_prompts["analysis"]
    )
```

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Basic Ethical Analysis
```python
from ethical_prompt_chainer import EthicalPromptChainer, ModelType

# Initialize the chainer
chainer = EthicalPromptChainer(model_type=ModelType.GPT4)

# Create a dilemma
dilemma = "Should AI be used for hiring decisions?"
context = [
    "AI can reduce human bias in hiring",
    "AI may perpetuate existing biases in training data"
]

# Guide the model's reasoning
result = chainer.guide_reasoning(dilemma, context)
```

### 2. Framework-Specific Analysis
```python
from ethical_prompt_chainer.ethical_frameworks import FrameworkType

# Get a specific framework
framework = chainer.get_framework(FrameworkType.UTILITARIAN)

# Guide reasoning with the framework
result = chainer.guide_reasoning(
    dilemma,
    context,
    framework=framework
)
```

### 3. Custom Prompt Chain
```python
# Create a custom prompt chain
prompts = [
    chainer.get_principle_identification_prompt(dilemma),
    chainer.get_reasoning_prompt(dilemma, principles),
    chainer.get_recommendation_prompt(reasoning)
]

# Guide the model through the chain
result = chainer.guide_through_prompts(prompts)
```

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Vague Responses
- Make prompts more specific
- Add explicit formatting requirements
- Include example responses

### 2. Inconsistent Reasoning
- Strengthen framework integration
- Add consistency checks
- Request explicit connections

### 3. Low Confidence
- Break down complex steps
- Add more context
- Request specific justifications

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Multi-Step Reasoning
```python
# Chain multiple prompts
prompts = [
    "First, identify the key ethical principles...",
    "Next, analyze how these principles apply...",
    "Finally, generate recommendations based on..."
]

# Guide the model through the steps
result = chainer.guide_through_prompts(prompts)
```

### 2. Context Enrichment
```python
# Add relevant context
context = [
    "Historical precedents",
    "Current regulations",
    "Stakeholder perspectives"
]

# Generate enriched prompt
prompt = chainer.enrich_prompt(base_prompt, context)
```

### 3. Framework Combination
```python
# Combine multiple frameworks
frameworks = [
    FrameworkType.UTILITARIAN,
    FrameworkType.DEONTOLOGICAL
]

# Guide reasoning with combined frameworks
result = chainer.guide_with_frameworks(dilemma, frameworks)
```

## Conclusion

Effective prompt engineering is key to improving AI model behavior. By following these guidelines and using the Ethical Prompt Chainer's structured approach, you can guide models toward more thoughtful, nuanced, and ethically-aware responses.

Remember to:
- Keep prompts clear and structured
- Provide sufficient context
- Use appropriate frameworks
- Monitor and adjust based on results
