# Ethical Frameworks Guide

This guide explains how to use ethical frameworks in the Ethical Prompt Chainer to guide AI model behavior.

## Understanding Ethical Frameworks

Ethical frameworks provide structured approaches to guide model reasoning. Each framework offers:
- Core principles for ethical consideration
- Guidance prompts for model behavior
- Evaluation criteria for responses

## Available Frameworks

### 1. Utilitarian Framework
```python
framework = EthicalFramework(
    type=FrameworkType.UTILITARIAN,
    principles=[
        "Maximize overall happiness",
        "Minimize suffering",
        "Consider consequences for all affected parties"
    ],
    guidance_prompts={
        "analysis": """
Consider the consequences of different actions:
1. What are the potential benefits and harms?
2. How many people would be affected?
3. What is the magnitude of impact?
4. How can we maximize overall well-being?
""",
        "evaluation": """
Evaluate the action based on:
1. Net impact on happiness
2. Distribution of benefits and harms
3. Long-term consequences
4. Alternative approaches
"""
    }
)
```

### 2. Deontological Framework
```python
framework = EthicalFramework(
    type=FrameworkType.DEONTOLOGICAL,
    principles=[
        "Respect for autonomy",
        "Duty to act morally",
        "Universal moral rules"
    ],
    guidance_prompts={
        "analysis": """
Consider the moral duties and rules:
1. What are the fundamental moral duties?
2. Are there universal rules that apply?
3. How does this respect autonomy?
4. What are the categorical imperatives?
""",
        "evaluation": """
Evaluate the action based on:
1. Adherence to moral duties
2. Universalizability
3. Respect for autonomy
4. Moral consistency
"""
    }
)
```

### 3. Virtue Framework
```python
framework = EthicalFramework(
    type=FrameworkType.VIRTUE,
    principles=[
        "Cultivate virtuous character",
        "Act with wisdom and courage",
        "Develop moral excellence"
    ],
    guidance_prompts={
        "analysis": """
Consider the virtuous approach:
1. What virtues are relevant?
2. How would a virtuous person act?
3. What character traits are important?
4. How can we cultivate moral excellence?
""",
        "evaluation": """
Evaluate the action based on:
1. Virtue cultivation
2. Character development
3. Moral wisdom
4. Excellence in practice
"""
    }
)
```

### 4. Care Framework
```python
framework = EthicalFramework(
    type=FrameworkType.CARE,
    principles=[
        "Prioritize relationships",
        "Consider context and needs",
        "Show empathy and compassion"
    ],
    guidance_prompts={
        "analysis": """
Consider the caring approach:
1. Who is affected and how?
2. What are their specific needs?
3. How can we show care and empathy?
4. What relationships are important?
""",
        "evaluation": """
Evaluate the action based on:
1. Relationship impact
2. Care and empathy shown
3. Context sensitivity
4. Need responsiveness
"""
    }
)
```

### 5. Sustainable Framework
```python
framework = EthicalFramework(
    type=FrameworkType.SUSTAINABLE,
    principles=[
        "Consider long-term impact",
        "Balance present and future needs",
        "Maintain ecological integrity"
    ],
    guidance_prompts={
        "analysis": """
Consider sustainability:
1. What are the long-term implications?
2. How does this affect future generations?
3. What ecological impacts are there?
4. How can we ensure sustainability?
""",
        "evaluation": """
Evaluate the action based on:
1. Long-term viability
2. Future impact
3. Ecological balance
4. Resource sustainability
"""
    }
)
```

## Using Frameworks

### 1. Basic Framework Application
```python
from ethical_prompt_chainer import EthicalPromptChainer, ModelType
from ethical_prompt_chainer.ethical_frameworks import FrameworkType

# Initialize the chainer
chainer = EthicalPromptChainer(model_type=ModelType.GPT4)

# Get a framework
framework = chainer.get_framework(FrameworkType.UTILITARIAN)

# Guide reasoning with the framework
result = chainer.guide_reasoning(
    dilemma="Should AI be used for hiring decisions?",
    context=["AI can reduce bias", "AI may perpetuate bias"],
    framework=framework
)
```

### 2. Framework Selection
```python
# Get applicable frameworks for a dilemma
frameworks = chainer.get_applicable_frameworks(dilemma)

# Use multiple frameworks
for framework in frameworks:
    result = chainer.guide_reasoning(dilemma, context, framework=framework)
```

### 3. Custom Framework Creation
```python
# Create a custom framework
custom_framework = EthicalFramework(
    type=FrameworkType.CUSTOM,
    principles=["Your principles..."],
    guidance_prompts={
        "analysis": "Your analysis prompt...",
        "evaluation": "Your evaluation prompt..."
    },
    evaluation_criteria=["Your criteria..."]
)

# Add to framework manager
framework_manager = EthicalFrameworkManager()
framework_manager.frameworks[FrameworkType.CUSTOM] = custom_framework
```

## Framework Integration

### 1. With Prompts
```python
# Get framework-specific prompt
prompt = chainer.get_framework_prompt(
    framework=framework,
    prompt_type=PromptType.REASONING_GUIDANCE
)

# Guide model with framework-specific prompt
result = chainer.guide_through_prompt(prompt)
```

### 2. With Model Behavior
```python
# Configure model behavior with framework
chainer.configure_model_behavior(
    model_type=ModelType.GPT4,
    framework=framework
)

# Guide reasoning with configured behavior
result = chainer.guide_reasoning(dilemma, context)
```

### 3. With Evaluation
```python
# Evaluate response against framework
evaluation = chainer.evaluate_response(
    response=result,
    framework=framework
)

# Get framework-specific metrics
metrics = evaluation.get_framework_metrics()
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Framework Selection
- Choose frameworks relevant to the dilemma
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Balance different ethical approaches

### 2. Framework Application
- Apply frameworks consistently
- Use appropriate guidance prompts
- Consider framework limitations

### 3. Framework Evaluation
- Assess framework effectiveness
- Monitor model behavior
- Adjust framework parameters

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Framework Combination
```python
# Combine multiple frameworks
combined_framework = chainer.combine_frameworks([
    FrameworkType.UTILITARIAN,
    FrameworkType.DEONTOLOGICAL
])

# Guide reasoning with combined framework
result = chainer.guide_reasoning(
    dilemma,
    context,
    framework=combined_framework
)
```

### 2. Dynamic Framework Selection
```python
# Select framework based on dilemma
framework = chainer.select_framework(dilemma)

# Guide reasoning with selected framework
result = chainer.guide_reasoning(
    dilemma,
    context,
    framework=framework
)
```

### 3. Framework Adaptation
```python
# Adapt framework for specific context
adapted_framework = chainer.adapt_framework(
    framework=framework,
    context=context
)

# Guide reasoning with adapted framework
result = chainer.guide_reasoning(
    dilemma,
    context,
    framework=adapted_framework
)
```

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Framework Conflicts
- Identify conflicting principles
- Prioritize relevant principles
- Seek balanced solutions

### 2. Framework Limitations
- Recognize framework boundaries
- Combine complementary frameworks
- Adapt to specific contexts

### 3. Model Behavior Issues
- Adjust guidance prompts
- Strengthen framework integration
- Monitor and correct behavior
