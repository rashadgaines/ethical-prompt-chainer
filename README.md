### Automated Data Validation
- Comprehensive validation of dilemma inputs
- Checks for minimum length, question format, and completeness
- Detailed error reporting and logging
- Integration with the main analysis pipeline

### Core Functionality
- Constitutional principle-based ethical analysis
- Stakeholder impact assessment
- Legal feasibility evaluation
- Comprehensive solution recommendations
- Monitoring plan generation

## Usage

```python
from ethical_prompt_chainer import EthicalPromptChainer

# Initialize the chainer
chainer = EthicalPromptChainer(model_name="gpt-4")

# Analyze a dilemma
dilemma = "Should universal basic income be implemented to reduce inequality, or should we maintain targeted welfare programs to avoid disincentivizing work?"
analysis = chainer.analyze_dilemma(dilemma)

# Print the formatted analysis
print(chainer.format_analysis(analysis))
```

## Example Output

```

## Ethical Framework

The tool uses a structured approach to ethical reasoning:

1. **Stakeholder Identification**: Identify all parties affected by the decision
2. **Consequence Analysis**: Evaluate potential outcomes and their impacts
3. **Principle Consideration**: Apply relevant ethical principles
4. **Solution Development**: Propose and justify a course of action

## Prompt Design and Analysis

### Prompt Chain Structure

The system uses a sophisticated chain of prompts to guide the model through ethical analysis:

1. **Initial Analysis Prompt**
   ```python
   "Analyze the following ethical dilemma: {dilemma}
   Consider the following aspects:
   - Core ethical principles involved
   - Key stakeholders affected
   - Potential consequences
   - Legal and regulatory context"
   ```

2. **Stakeholder Impact Prompt**
   ```python
   "For the identified stakeholders in the dilemma: {stakeholders}
   Evaluate:
   - Direct and indirect impacts
   - Power dynamics
   - Vulnerability factors
   - Mitigation needs"
   ```

3. **Long-term Impact Prompt**
   ```python
   "Assess the long-term implications:
   - Future scenarios (best/worst/most likely)
   - Sustainability metrics
   - Intergenerational effects
   - Risk factors"
   ```

4. **Solution Generation Prompt**
   ```python
   "Based on the analysis, propose solutions that:
   - Address key ethical concerns
   - Balance stakeholder interests
   - Consider long-term impacts
   - Include implementation safeguards"
   ```

### Prompt Influence Analysis

Our analysis of prompt influence on model behavior reveals several key findings:

1. **Context Sensitivity**
   - Models show higher accuracy when prompts include specific context markers
   - Economic dilemmas benefit from explicit cost-benefit framing
   - Social dilemmas require emphasis on stakeholder relationships
   - Environmental dilemmas need clear sustainability metrics

2. **Chain-of-Thought Benefits**
   - Step-by-step reasoning prompts improve consistency
   - Explicit principle application reduces bias
   - Structured analysis leads to more comprehensive solutions
   - Clear separation of concerns improves clarity

3. **Framework Integration**
   - Multiple ethical frameworks provide more balanced analysis
   - Framework-specific prompts help maintain focus
   - Weighted consideration of principles improves outcomes
   - Cross-framework validation reduces bias

4. **Impact on Output Quality**
   - Detailed prompts produce more nuanced analysis
   - Structured prompts improve consistency
   - Context-aware prompts enhance relevance
   - Multi-step prompts reduce hallucinations
